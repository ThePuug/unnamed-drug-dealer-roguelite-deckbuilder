# Narrative System Specification

## Player Experience Goal
The narrative system should transform the abstract math of card mechanics into a coherent, thematic story. Players should feel like their actions (playing cards) are building a narrative scene, not just incrementing counters. The stories should feel "emergent" and "organic," avoiding the repetitive feel of mad-libs or static templates.

## Core Mechanics
- **Emergent Storytelling:** The story is generated *after* the hand is resolved, based on the specific combination of cards played and the outcome.
- **Context Awareness:** The story reflects the Buyer's persona, the specific Product sold, the Location used, and any Complications (Evidence) or Actions taken.
- **Dynamic Structure:** Sentence structures vary naturally. Sometimes the location is mentioned first ("At the park..."), sometimes last ("...down by the docks"). Sometimes the complication is the focus ("Although the cops were watching..."), sometimes it's a footnote.

## Player Interactions
- **Passive Consumption:** Players do not "write" the story; they generate it through their gameplay choices.
- **Review:** Players can read the story in the resolution overlay and potentially in a "Run History" log.

## Feedback and Clarity
- **Thematic Reinforcement:** The story reinforces the "drug dealer" fantasy.
- **Outcome Reflection:** The tone of the story matches the outcome (Safe = relieved/successful, Busted = tense/regretful).

## Fun Factor Analysis
- **Memorability:** Unique stories make individual hands memorable.
- **Shareability:** "You won't believe how I got away with this" moments are captured in text.
- **Immersion:** Bridges the gap between mechanics (numbers) and theme (crime).

## Edge Cases and Polish
- **Fallbacks:** If a specific card lacks narrative content, the system must fall back to generic text so the story never breaks.
- **Grammar:** Sentences must always be grammatically correct (capitalization, punctuation, conjunctions).
- **Variety:** The system must avoid repeating the same sentence structure too often, even for similar hands.
